// This is a generic manifest file that is mounted by all maps that don't already have their own.
// This was created so that mappers can create files of generic names without having to create their own manifest file.
// There is no penalty for having a file missing. You could use this as a template for your own manifest file, too.
// 
// Remember: Maps with their own default manifest file (%mapname%_manifest.txt) will *not* load this file.
// 
// Tokens:
// %mapname% - The map's filename
// %language% - UI language
